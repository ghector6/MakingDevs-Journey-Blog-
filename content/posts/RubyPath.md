# Ruby ðŸ’Ž
---------------------------------

## What is Ruby?

Ruby is a high-level programming language, meaning it doesnÂ´t talk directly to the hardware, it is written and the intepreted to code by the interpreter (YARV).

Even though Ruby is usually explained as a multi paradigm language, itÂ´s important to say that it focus on OOP, but it also implements different concepts from other programming paradigms.

-----------------------------------

## Installing Ruby.

Beware that Ruby comes by default in some OS... so make sure by running in the command line:

`ruby -v`

It is also important to say that there are multiple ways to install Ruby. I personally recommend using a version manager, such as asdf (We will cover that later)

### Installing from RubyÂ´s website.

[Installing Ruby from their website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) is relatively easy. 

You can follow the steps found in the link above!
